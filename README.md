# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules.

Currently, there are two official plugins available:

- `@vitejs/plugin-react`: Uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
- `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`: Uses SWC for Fast Refresh.

This is a movie page.

## Run

To run the code:

```sh
yarn dev
